# Natural Language Processing

This repository consists of assignments that I did as part of course INLP/Spring24.

It consists of the following tasks :

### Tokenization and Language Modelling

Developed a tokenizer and implemented language modeling with smoothing techniques such as Good-Turing and Interpolation to enhance language processing accuracy and performance.

### POS Tagging

Developed POS taggers using Feedforward Neural Networks (FFNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, showcasing advanced proficiency in neural network architectures for natural language processing tasks.

### Word2Vec and SVD word embeddings

Developed word embeddings using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and Skip-Gram with Negative Sampling, and evaluated their performance by using them for the downstream classification task.

### ELMO

Implemented deep contextualized word representations using ELMo with BiLSTM layers as described in the paper "Deep Contextualized Word Representations" by Peters et al and evaluated these embeddings on a downstream classification task.
